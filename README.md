# Assignment-4: Python Programming Tasks

Welcome to **Assignment-4**! This repository includes various Python exercises that demonstrate the use of functions, conditional logic, and user input handling. Each task in this repository is aimed at helping you understand the fundamental concepts of Python programming.

## üìú Project Overview

This repository contains Python code for a series of small programs, each focusing on a specific aspect of programming such as:

- Implementing helper functions.
- Taking user input and printing results based on conditions.
- Performing mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, and comparison.
- Managing string manipulation, number checks, and logic branching.

## üöÄ Features

- **Subtraction Function**: A helper function that subtracts a fixed number from a given value.
- **User Data Handling**: A function to collect and return user data (first name, last name, email).
- **Conditional Logic**: Functions that use `if-else` statements to perform actions based on input.
- **Data Validation**: Programs that validate whether a given number or data meets certain conditions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

To run the code, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- A text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as:
  - **VSCode**
  - **PyCharm**
  - **Sublime Text**
